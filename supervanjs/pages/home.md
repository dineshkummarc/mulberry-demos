On Saturday, January 14 we're having our first Super VanJS!

Instead of our normal two speakers on a weeknight, we've teamed up with Mozilla
and Steam Clock Software to bring in five speakers during a Saturday afternoon.

Our first batch of tickets sold out so we've moved to a larger space at SFU
Harbour Center! Additional tickets are free, but don't include a drink at the
afterparty.
